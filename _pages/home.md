### About me

Anarghya is a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate supervised by [Dr. Wenyao Xu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/), studying at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Anarghya obtained his undergraduate degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from the University at Buffalo (UB) in 2021. His research focus revolves around advancing and implementing wearable technology-driven solutions in healthcare, often referred to as **Smart Health**. Specifically, Anarghya delves into **Mobile Computing** and **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, aiming to innovate at the intersection of neuroscience and technology.

As a BCI researcher, Anarghya conceptualizes, designs, implements, and evaluates comprehensive BCI systems, exploring various innovative applications within the field. Notably, he has delved into EEG compression techniques in wearable computing and the fusion of EEG and voice data to enhance the capabilities of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between physiological signals and machine learning algorithms, fostering more effective healthcare solutions.

Beyond BCI, Anarghya has actively contributed to projects aimed at enhancing healthcare technologies and rehabilitation experiences. For instance, in the mRehab project, he engineered a system that integrates smartphone apps and 3D-printed household items to assist stroke survivors in remote home-based therapy. Similarly, in MidiGait, he designed a system utilizing smart insoles and smartphone technology to facilitate melodic gait rehabilitation in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. Furthermore, his involvement in the Sense2Quit project entailed exploring the potential of mobile health technology in smoking cessation interventions for individuals living with HIV.
