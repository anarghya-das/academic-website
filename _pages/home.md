### About me

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate studying at the University at Buffalo (UB) in the field Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs). I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics from the University at Buffalo (UB) in 2021. My research focus centers on advancing and implementing wearable technology-driven solutions in healthcare, often called **Smart Health**. Specifically, I delve into **Mobile Computing** and **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, where I aim to innovate at the intersection of neuroscience and technology. 

As a BCI researcher, I conceptualize, design, implement, and evaluate comprehensive BCI systems. My exploration spans various innovative applications within this field. Notably, I have delved into EEG compression techniques in wearable computing and into the fusion of EEG and voice data to amplify the capabilities of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. These endeavors aim to bridge the divide between physiological signals and machine learning algorithms, fostering more effective healthcare solutions.

Beyond BCI, I have actively contributed to projects to enhance healthcare technologies and rehabilitation experiences. For instance, in the mRehab project, I engineered a system that integrates smartphone apps and 3D-printed household items to assist stroke survivors in remote home-based therapy. Similarly, in MidiGait, I designed a system utilizing smart insoles and smartphone technology to facilitate melodic gait rehabilitation in Parkinson's patients. Furthermore, my involvement in the Sense2Quit project entailed exploring the potential of mobile health technology in smoking cessation interventions for individuals living with HIV.
